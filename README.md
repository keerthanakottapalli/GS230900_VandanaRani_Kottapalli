# **Requirements**

# **1 System Requirements**
- Node.js v18+
- npm
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Internet connection (for Firebase authentication)

# **2 Dependencies Used**
- **React** (v18)
- **AG-Grid** (for tables)
- **Recharts** (for charts)

# **How to Run the Application**

# **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/keerthanakottapalli/GS230900_VandanaRani_Kottapalli
cd GS230900_VandanaRani_Kottapalli

# Install dependencies

# Run the App

npm start
# OR
yarn start

# Testing the App

Login Page: **Use a test email/password to sign in**.
Navigation: Test the sidebar navigation between Stores, SKUs, Planning, and Chart pages.
Data Handling:
Add, edit, delete Stores & SKUs.
Modify Sales Units in AG-Grid (Planning Screen).
Verify Chart updates dynamically when selecting a store.
Logout Functionality: Click the profile icon â†’ logout to test session handling.

# Challenge Highlights: What I Did Well

**Used AG-Grid for SKU & Planning screens.**
Implemented real-time updates for Sales Units.
Ensured column grouping for weeks under months.
# Why it shows my proficiency?
AG-Grid is powerful but requires careful state management, performance optimization, and cell editing logic. I successfully implemented:

Inline editing with automatic calculations.
Column group headers for weekly data.
Custom styling & conditional formatting (GM % color coding).

**Charting with Dual Axis (Recharts)**
Implemented bar to show GM Dollars & GM %.
Aggregated data per store, totaling GM & Sales Dollars.
Dynamic chart updates when a store is selected.
Why this matters?
Handling dual-axis charts & aggregating data from thousands of rows efficiently shows my ability to work with data visualization & performance optimization.

**Firebase Authentication**
Implemented email & password login.
Session persistence using onAuthStateChanged().
Logout button inside a dropdown profile menu.
**Why it's important?**
Security and user authentication are crucial in real-world apps. I efficiently set up Firebase Auth with proper session handling.

# What I Would Improve with 4 More Hours?

**Jest-Based Unit Testing**
Add unit tests for core features (e.g., login validation, store/sku management).
Test AG-Grid updates & ensure correct calculations.
Why?
Unit tests improve reliability and prevent regressions.

**Optimize Large Data Handling**
Currently, 27,000+ sales data points are stored in JSON.
Implement pagination & lazy loading for large datasets.
Why?
Better performance & memory optimization when handling large data.
